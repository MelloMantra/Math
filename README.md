# Math
My personal math projects.

This repository includes documents detailing my mathematical inventions (real and fake), as well as coding projects modeling math concepts and such.

The heat equation modeling program works for integer time step values. Currently working on generalization.
DiagZip was a failed attempt at creating a data compression program using matrix diagonalization. May return to this project if I can find an efficient way of storing eigenvectors.
